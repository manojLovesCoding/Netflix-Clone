# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


🚀 Building a Netflix Clone with React, Firebase, and TMDB API 🎥

I'm excited to share a project I recently completed, where I built a Netflix Clone website that allows users to browse movie details and manage their own accounts! 💻✨

With the help of GreatStack tutorials, I was able to bring this idea to life, integrating several key features:

*Movie Data Integration*: I used the *TMDB API* to fetch and display movie details, such as titles, posters—making the website feel just like Netflix!
*User Authentication*: To allow for a personalized experience, I integrated *Firebase Authentication* so users can *create an account* and *log in* securely. 🔐
*Notifications*: I used *React-Toastify* to show friendly notifications (e.g., on successful login or error messages), enhancing the user experience. 🎉

This project was a great learning experience, and feel free to check out demo
